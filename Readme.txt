Desktop_file_write

A module to simplify writing to a desktop file from PHP.

The module can be included where needed. It can produce a number
of the most common file formats. The test module provides some
samples of using the module to produce various formats.

The modules provide more details.

Creating a file this way will not work properly if you are attempting 
to echo anything else prior to producing the file. Anything that is
echo'd will be included in the file output.
